It was an interesting day. We are working on creating a code of conduct that will guide us throughout this training year.

The way in which the topic was addressed throughout the morning was undoubtedly very interesting and constructive.

During the afternoon we had the pleasure of having a different Basic Digital Literacy trainer who demonstrated, at least for me, what I have been thinking about teaching our resident trainer……

…. the day got off to a bad start, really bad to tell you the truth, our resident coach came back and with him the disorganized teaching.

It is not possible to try to teach commands in the “terminal” and not know what to respond to unforeseen situations.

At one point, I lost my temper and was very direct in expressing my frustration with the matter.

I should have had a different attitude, it wasn't good on my part and after the break I asked to speak in front of everyone, apologizing to the coach and other colleagues.

I realized that my learning ambitions do not match the slow and disorganized way we are experiencing in this course, but obviously I will have to adapt to these conditions, so I will remain discreet for the sake of my path in this course and the well-being of other colleagues ...

,,, The day started strange and some people in the group started to feel the same frustration that I felt from the beginning.

During the morning break, some people in the group decided to question the trainer about his way of teaching. I chose to turn off the camera and sound, I promised myself I'll keep a low profile, and I will.

After resuming the class, things evolved in a more fluid way, I hope I can finally start talking here about everything that has to do with the Web Development course and nothing about everything else.

We are essentially talking about the terminal installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
There were some problems with the way it was demonstrated in class, personally I opted for a different and more effective approach, using different commands than those used in class…

* source ~/.bashrc
* nvm list-remote
* nvm install v18.14.0   -  **in V18.14.0 you replace with the latest version or the one you want from the list presented in the previous command**
* nvm lts/hydrogen installation
* node -v

with the last command should appear .....

v18.14.0

After....

* npm install -g npm@9.4.2
* sudo apt install rpm

thereby keeping "node.js" and "npm" installed and updated

In the afternoon the theme was centered on the “rpm” command

* npm init
* code .

It is

Install an “npm” package.
Check if and where this package has been installed.
What command was used to check if and where the package was installed?

A way to test commands in the terminal.

At the end we did an evaluation
