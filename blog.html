          February 7, 2023 <br /><br />
          First day! The anticipation of the start of a new adventure, the first
          steps in a career completely different from anything I had done here,
          creates an tingling like I haven't felt in many years. <br /><br />
          Having the exact notion that this is the opportunity of a lifetime,
          the anxiety to get started is enormous.
          <br /><br />
          At the age of 49 and a half, which is characterized by essentially
          never having been a happy and accomplished person on a professional
          level, the beginning of this adventure that is Web Development gives
          me the hope of finally doing something that I truly enjoy
          professionally.
          <br /><br />
          Who would have thought that on August 24, 2020, when I ended my
          driving shift, I was struggling atrociously with unimaginable and
          impossible to describe pain, to the point of having entered the
          emergency room at the hospital in Rotthalmünster with a pain level of
          10 out of 10 and being immediately hospitalized for 5 days just for
          pain control, it would be the only (very painful) part of a long stage
          of surgeries, pain, suffering, tears and a lot of frustration that
          would bring me here to this new adventure….
          <br /><br />
          …. Web Development.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-overview">
          February 10, 2023 <br /><br />
          8:45! -I turned on the computer, opened the Slack app to see if I had
          any relevant messages. I clicked on the link that takes me to the Zoom
          meeting.<br /><br />
          After some anticipation, the day finally arrived. This long journey of
          over a year has begun.<br /><br />
          New faces, new lives, new dynamics are about to enter my screen and
          who, throughout this learning that will take place online every day
          and week, will share this adventure with me.<br /><br />
          The first few hours are acquaintance, normal formalities.<br /><br />
          After introducing us to the Trainer who will accompany us on this
          adventure and after the first few minutes, something immediately jumps
          out, his calm manner (too calm) and somewhat disorganized with regard
          to the organization of thoughts shows that a lot of caffeine will be
          needed.<br /><br />
          With the day ending, there was some skepticism towards the
          trainer...<br /><br />
          ...as the week went on, my fears about the trainer's way of teaching
          were confirmed. He is definitely a know-it-all, but his peculiar way
          of teaching very slow and a little disorganized is creating serious
          concentration problems for me.<br /><br />
          It took us two days on a topic that should have been covered in one
          morning, frustration starts to get the better of me and we're still on
          the third day of training. I notice that the disgust with this
          situation is reflected in some other training colleagues. I confess
          that I am a very patient person with people, but inexplicably it is
          not like that, I feel frustrated because I expected much more
          (dynamics) and I fear that if it continues at this pace it will
          certainly not be an easy year…<br /><br />
          ...Friday, Soft Skills day. But what a breath of fresh air this day
          was. Dynamic, cheerful, with a lot of interaction between everyone and
          very, very interesting and enriching in terms of personal and
          collective knowledge.<br /><br />
          The Coach knew how to captivate us for this session from the first
          moment. Compared to the previous days, it was like a huge and
          much-needed decompression. I deeply regret that we are only presented
          with the presence of this Coach for two sessions.

          week of contradictions

        <div class="blog-overview">
          <strong>February 13, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day. We are working on creating a code of
          conduct that will guide us throughout this training year. <br /><br />
          The way in which the topic was addressed throughout the morning was
          undoubtedly very interesting and constructive.<br /><br />
          During the afternoon we had the pleasure of having a different Basic
          Digital Literacy trainer who demonstrated, at least for me, what I
          have been thinking about teaching our resident trainer……<br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          <strong>February 14, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          …. the day got off to a bad start, really bad to tell you the truth,
          our resident coach came back and with him the disorganized
          teaching.<br /><br />
          It is not possible to try to teach commands in the “terminal” and not
          know what to respond to unforeseen situations.<br /><br />
          At one point, I lost my temper and was very direct in expressing my
          frustration with the matter.<br /><br />
          I should have had a different attitude, it wasn&#39;t good on my part
          and after the break I asked to speak in front of everyone, apologizing
          to the coach and other colleagues. <br /><br />
          I realized that my learning ambitions do not match the slow and
          disorganized way we are experiencing in this course, but obviously I
          will have to adapt to these conditions, so I will remain discreet for
          the sake of my path in this course and the well-being of other
          colleagues ...
          <br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          <p id="Node-js"><strong> February 15, 2023</strong><br /><br /></p>
          ,,, The day started strange and some people in the group started to
          feel the same frustration that I felt from the beginning.
          <br /><br />
          During the morning break, some people in the group decided to question
          the trainer about his way of teaching. I chose to turn off the camera
          and sound, I promised myself I&#39;ll keep a low profile, and I will.
          <br /><br />
          After resuming the class, things evolved in a more fluid way, I hope I
          can finally start talking here about everything that has to do with
          the Web Development course and nothing about everything else.
          <br /><br />
          We are essentially talking about the terminal installation of
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> There were some problems
          with the way it was demonstrated in class, personally I opted for a
          different and more effective approach, using different commands than
          those used in class…

          <ul>
            <li>source ~/.bashrc</li>
            <li>nvm list-remote</li>
            <li>
              nvm install v18.14.0
              <strong>
                in V18.14.0 you replace with the latest version or the one you
                want from the list presented in the previous command</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>nvm lts/hydrogen installation</li>
            <li>node -v</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />with the last command should appear .....<br /><br />
          <br /><br />18.14.0<br /><br />
          <br /><br />After....<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>npm install -g npm@9.4.2</li>
            <li>sudo apt install rpm</li>
          </ul>
          Thereby keeping &quot;node.js&quot; and &quot;npm&quot; installed and
          updated<br /><br />
          In the afternoon the theme was centered on the “rpm” command<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>npm init</li>
            <li>code .</li>

          <br /><br /><strong>February 16, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day dedicated to “Git”<br /><br />
          <p id="git"><strong>What is Git?</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
          designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
          speed and efficiency.<br /><br />
          After that, we start its installation and start using basic commands
          for your use…
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-installation">sudo apt-get install git</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          After installing it, start your terminal and type the following
          command to verify that Git is ready to be used on your computer:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-version">git –version</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          In your terminal, run the following commands to identify yourself with
          Git:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-config">
              git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;
            </li>
            <li>git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.com&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          To create a new repository and start tracking your project with Git,
          use your terminal
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-init">git init</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          This is a command that is very often used when working with Git. It
          shows us which files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-status">git status</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <p id="staging-files"><strong>staging files</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          From the project folder, we can use the git add command to add our
          files to the staging area, which allows them to be tracked. We can add
          a specific file to the staging area with the following command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-add-1-file">git add [filename]</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />o add multiple files, we can do this:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-add-multi-file">
              git add [filename.1] [filename.2] [filename.3]
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Instead of having to add the files individually, we can also add all
          the files inside the project folder to the staging area:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-add-all-file">git add .</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          By default, this adds all the files and folders inside the project
          folder to the staging area, from where they are ready to be committed
          and tracked.
          <br /><br />
          <p id="making-commits"><strong>Making commits</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          A commit is a snapshot of our code at a particular time, which we are
          saving to the commit history of our repository. After adding all the
          files that we want to track to the staging area with the
          <strong>git add</strong> command, we are ready to make a commit.
          <br /><br />
          To commit the files from the staging area, we use the following
          command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Inside the quotes, we should write a commit message which is used to
          identify it in the commit history.
          <br /><br />
          The commit message should be a descriptive summary of the changes you
          are committing to the repository.
          <br /><br />
          <p id="branching"><strong>Branching</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          Git branching allows developers to diverge from the production version
          of code to fix a bug or add a feature. Developers create branches to
          work with a copy of the code without modifying the existing
          version.<br /><br />
          You create branches to isolate your code changes, which you test
          before merging to the main branch Whenever we initialize a folder as a
          repository, there will be one default branch (typically called
          master).
          <br /><br />
          We can create a branch that is a copy of (usually) the main branch.
          Then you can add your changes to this branch without affecting the
          main branch.
          <br /><br /><strong>Creating a new branch</strong><br /><br />
          You can create a new branch using the following command:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="merging-branches">merging branches</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Once we create a branch from master, they start living separate lives
          so to say. We don&#39;t want this to continue for too long, because it
          will become harder and harder to bring the two together.
          <br /><br />
          For example, after you fully implemented and tested a new feature in
          your code, you would want to merge those changes to the stable branch
          of your project (which is usually the default master branch). To merge
          the changes from a different branch into your current branch, you can
          use this command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-marge">git merge "branch-name"</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />t was a good day of learning...<br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 17, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          <p id="soft-skills-1"><em>soft skills day</em></p>
          <br /><br />
          Once again it was an interesting day where we focused on communication
          and feelings.<br /><br />
          We focus on “Communications Square - Friedemann Schulz von Thun” in
          <em>“Appreciative communication”</em><br /><br />
          In another topic we talk about the topic: non-violent communication
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>what we are feeling</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          The big difference goal: learn to differentiate own feelings from
          interpretation, diagnoses, thoughts
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Universal Needs</li>

          <br />
          <p>
            Was created by Linus Torvalds to track changes to a project from
            multiple authors
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Who likes the idea of travelling through time?</h2>
          <br />

          <p>GIT is a way to travel through time for your project!</p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
          <br />
          <p>GIT is a command line tool</p>
          <p>We use GIT to keep track of changes to files</p>
          <p>
            We can travel through those changes and see how a project appeared
            earlier in time

          <p>
            GIT <strong>does not automatically</strong> add your changes,
            <strong>until you tell it to</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            GIT will keep track of any file changes after you&#39;ve used
            <strong>git add</strong> to track them
          </p>
          <p>
            Each change or set of changes are recorded within the GIT repository
            as a <strong>commit</strong>
          </p>

          <p>Remember GitHub and GIT are separate entities</p>
          <p>
            When configuring GIT, this has nothing to do with your GitHub
            account
          </p>
          <p>There is no such thing as a &quot;GIT account&quot;</p>
          <p>When you configure GIT;</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot; git config
            --global user.email &quot;<a

          </p>
          <p>
            There is no &quot;verification&quot; of that data - you can write
            anything you like
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want change any of the configuration settings, you can just

          <p>
            You can link to your remote repositories using either the
            <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocol or the <strong>SSH</strong> protocol

          <h3 id="https">HTTPS</h3>
          <br />

          <p>
            Using <strong>HTTPS</strong> means that every time you want to
            interact with your remote repository, you have to enter your
            username and password
          </p>
          <br />

          <br />

          <p>Secure Shell</p>
          <p>
            Before you can use <strong>SSH</strong>, you have to generate an
            <strong>SSH</strong> key - which will automatically be used when you
            interact with your remote repository
          </p>
          <p>
            More work to setup to setup at the start, but saves you time
            compared to HTTPS

          <ul>
            <li>Dieter</li>
            <li>Mary</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li><p>One of these people must create a repository</p></li>
            <li><p>Mary creates the repository on GitHub</p></li>
            <li><p>She shares the URL of the repository with Dieter</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>She uses <strong>git clone</strong> to make a copy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Dieter uses <strong>git clone</strong> to make a copy</p>

          <h2 id="git-commit">GIT commits</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            When you create a commit, the contents of that commit should be
            related to each other
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you make changes to the homepage - when you make
            your commit for the homepage, it should only include those changes
            for the homepage
          </p>
          <br />

              Before you can create a commit, you must add the files to the
              commit with <strong>git add</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>git add .</strong> - adds everything
            <strong>git add index.html</strong> - add just index.html
          </p>
          <ol start="2">
            <li>
              <strong>git commit -m &quot;Here is my message&quot;</strong>
            </li>

          <h2>Commands</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>git push</strong> - sends new commits to the
            <strong>remote repository</strong>. Only sends commits!
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Any changes outside of a commit are NOT sent (pushed) to the
              remote
            </p>
            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>git pull</strong> - pulls changes from the
            <strong>remote repository</strong> to the
            <strong>local repository</strong>
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you have any uncommitted changes,
              <strong>git pull</strong> will abort
            </p>
            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>git fetch</strong> - ask the remote, have any new branches
            been added?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>git checkout {branch}</strong> - checks out to a specific
            branch, for example <strong>git checkout main</strong> will take you
            to the <strong>main</strong> branch
          </p>

          <h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Within your repository, you can have multiple versions of the code
            you are working on
          </p>
          <p>
            Most repositories will have a <strong>main</strong> or
            <strong>master</strong> branch, which represents the up-to-date
            version of the application.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              When you&#39;re working in a team, if everybody commits to the
              same branch - it gets messy very quickly, because you are dealing
              with multiple commits and some of these commits may override each
              other (merge conflict)
            </li>
            <li>
              What if you make a mistake? What if you break the code? Working in
              a separate branch means your code is isolated from the rest of the
              team - any faults would be contained.

          <blockquote>

          <p>
            ,,, Today we start a new Module
            <em><strong>&quot;User Interface Basic&quot;</strong></em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard language used to
            create the structure and content of web pages. HTML provides a basic
            user interface for displaying text, images, and other media on the
            internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of user interface, HTML provides the building blocks for
            creating interactive elements like buttons, forms, and menus. These
            elements can be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create
            a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML also provides the ability to include hyperlinks, which allow
            users to navigate between pages and websites. This is an essential
            aspect of the user interface as it enables users to access the
            information they are looking for quickly and efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, HTML provides the foundation for creating a user-friendly
            and interactive web interface. By using HTML along with CSS and
            other programming languages, developers can create complex web
            applications and websites that are easy to use and navigate.

            Day dedicated to Soft Skills with the theme
            <em><strong>&quot;Intercultural Competences&quot;</strong></em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>But what are <em>Intercultural Competences?</em></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Intercultural competences refer to the ability to understand,
            communicate, and interact effectively with people from different
            cultures. It involves the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to
            navigate diverse cultural settings and to build positive
            relationships with people from different backgrounds.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Some common intercultural competences include:</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Cultural awareness: having an understanding of one&#39;s own
            cultural background and being open to learning about other cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication skills: being able to communicate effectively with
            people from different cultures, including the ability to listen
            actively, ask questions, and provide feedback.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Flexibility and adaptability: being able to adjust one&#39;s
            behavior and communication style to fit different cultural contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy: being able to understand and appreciate the perspectives
            and experiences of people from different cultures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Conflict resolution skills: being able to resolve conflicts that may
            arise in intercultural interactions, including the ability to
            negotiate, compromise, and find mutually acceptable solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing intercultural competences is becoming increasingly
            important in our globalized world, where people from different
            cultures are increasingly working and living together.

          A new week will start with a new Teacher and this time apparently
          permanent, I checked her corriculun on LinkedIn and it is impressive,
          I confess that for a first impression it surprises for the positive
          and with a didactic that pleases.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>We&#39;ve covered <strong>&quot;Classes and IDs&quot;</strong>...</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We start by talking about pages, the &quot;head&quot; section and the
          elements it contains
        </p>
        <p>
          To start we need make sure the starting page is called
          <strong><em>index.html</em></strong> otherwise the server will not
          recognize it and you will see a bunch of files and directories
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="favicon">Favicon</h2>
        <br />

        <p>We started by talking about the Favicon and its importance</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>A favicon is a little icon that appears in the browser tab</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2 id="css-links">CSS links</h2>
        <br />

        <p>external css (recommended) <strong>priority 3</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><code
              >&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
              href=&quot;css/styles.css&quot; /&gt;</code
            ></em
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>internal css <strong>priority 2</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to add internal styles we use the style tag</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>inline css <strong>(highest priority 1)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to add inline style we use the style ATTRIB</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em
            ><code
              >&lt;h1 style=&quot;background-color: lightblue&quot;&gt;Classes
              and IDs&lt;/h1&gt;</code
            ></em
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          We have seen how to style an element using the general selector (eg.
          h1, p etc..) We can also select elments using <em>classes</em> and
          <em>IDs</em>
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="what-is-classes">What is Classes?</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The <strong><em>class</em></strong> attribute specifies one or more
          class names for an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes are used by <em>CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> to select and
          access specific elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The class attribute can be used on any <strong>HTML element</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The class name is <strong><em>case sensitive</em></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.</p>
        <p>
          We can applying multiple classes to the same element In the example
          below &quot;redBg&quot; and &quot;white&quot; are 2 different classes.
        </p>
        <p>We need to make sure you leave a space between them.</p>
        <p>
          <br />

          *<code>
            &lt;p&gt; class=&quot;redBg greenBg white&quot;&gt;Multiple
            classes&lt;/p&gt;</code
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="what-is-ids">What is IDs?</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The HTML <em>id</em> attribute is used to specify a
          <strong><em>unique id for an HTML element</em></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value
          of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The id attribute is used to point to a
          <em>specific style declaration</em> in a style sheet. It is also used
          by <em>JavaScript</em> to access and manipulate the element with the
          specific id.
        </p>
        <p>
          The syntax for id is: write a hash character
          <strong><em>(#)</em></strong
          >, followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within
          curly braces {}.
        </p>

        <h2 id="links-and-pseudo-classes">Links and pseudo classes</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          A website is made up by several pages. In order to jump from one page
          to the other we use links
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="link-features">Link features</h2>
        <br />

        <ul>

          <li>An visited link is underlined and purple</li>
          <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2 id="link-in-action">Link in action</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          To create a link use the &quot;a&quot; tag href is a very important
          attribute. It describes the link destination
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            INTERNAL LINK An internal link points to a page within your project
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>
          <code
            >&lt;p&gt;To go to the about page click &lt;a
            href=&quot;aboutPage.html&quot;&gt; HERE &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            EXTERNAL LINK Points you to a page located elsewhere.. outside of
            your project/domain
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          MAKE SURE external links open in a new tab by using the TARGET
          attribute
        </p>

        <h2><em>March 1, 2023</em></h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          ,,, Today we start with
          <strong><em>&quot;Selectors and combinators&quot;</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p id="combinators">CSS <em>Combinators</em></p>
        <br />

        <p>
          A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the
          selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the
          simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
          <li>child selector (&gt;)</li>
          <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
          <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2 id="descendant-selector">Descendant Selector</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a
          specified element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example selects all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements
          inside <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code> `&lt;section&gt;
    
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p><em>DESCENDANT (space)</em></p>
        <pre><code>`h2 span { /_ selects a span inside an h2 (loose) _/
    
    color: cadetblue;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 30px;
    background-color: white;
    
    }`
    </code></pre>
        <br />

        <h2 id="child-selector">Child Selector (&gt;)</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a
          specified element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements that
          are children of a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code> `&lt;section&gt;
    
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br />

        <pre><code>`section &gt; p { /* selects a p that is an immediate child of section */
    
    border: 5px dashed green;
    }`
    </code></pre>
        <br />

        <h2 id="adjacent-sibling-selector">Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is
          directly after another specific element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and
          &quot;adjacent&quot; means &quot;immediately following&quot;.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The following example selects the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element
          that are placed immediately after <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`&lt;div&gt;I am Div&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;I am the first p following a div&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am the second p following a div &lt;/p&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <br />

          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`div + p { /* The FIRST p coming IMMEDIATELY AFTER a div will be selected */
    
    background-color: orange;
    }`
    </code></pre>
        <br />

        <h2 id="general-sibling-selector">General Sibling Selector (~)</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next
          siblings of a specified element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example selects all <code>&lt;purple&gt;</code> class,
          elements that are next siblings of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`&lt;div class=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;All ul after me will have a purple background&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;item 3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;item 4&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <br />

          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`.purple ~ ul { /* All ULs coming after .purple will be selected */
    
     background-color: purple;
    }`
    </code></pre>

        <h2><em>March 2, 2023</em></h2>
        <br />

        <p id="css-units">
          It was a day dedicated to <em><strong>Css Units</strong></em>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Css units are important for setting dimensions (height, width, margin
          etc..)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>CSS has several different units for expressing a length.</p>
        <p>
          <br />
          Many CSS properties take <strong>&quot;length&quot;</strong> values,
          such as <em>width</em>, <em>margin</em>, <em>padding</em>,
          <em>font-size</em>, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> A whitespace cannot appear between the number
          and the unit. However, if the value is <em><strong>0</strong></em
          >, the unit can be omitted.
        </p>
        <p>For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.</p>
        <br />
        <p>There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.</p>

        <em><strong> Pixels pros and cons </strong></em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            px
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pixels will always look the same across all devices (mobile
                desktop, tablet)
              </li>
              <li>PRO: easy to work with</li>
              <li>CONS: Not good for responsive design</li>
              <li>CONS: Px override user's preference (browser)</li>
              <li>TIP: Never set font-size in PX</li>
              <li>
                USAGE: px for minor adjustments (shadows, borders and specific
                things)

        <h3>Percentage % (relative to its immediate parent)</h3>

        <div>25%</div>
        <br />

        <em
          ><strong>
            This box is less wide because it's 25% of the parent width ( 150px )
          </strong></em

            <ul>
              <li>
                relative to the parent WIDTH. Height in % will not work UNLESS
                the parent has a hight set in px.
              </li>
              <li>PRO - useful for building layouts that shrink and grow</li>
              <li>
                CONS - You might have excessive shrinkage so use it in combo
                with max-width and min-width
              </li>
              <li>USAGE - Large layout concerns</li>

              <li>PRO - Useful to fill up entire hight/width</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Relative to font size of root element (html)</li>
              <li>PRO - handles nested elements properly</li>
              <li>
                CONS - may require some calculations when translating to PX
              </li>

        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>"em"</strong> is a bit special and we have to bear in mind
          that the values are relative to the font-size of element
          <strong>(2em means 2 times more the size of the corrent font)</strong>
