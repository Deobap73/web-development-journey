          February 7, 2023 <br /><br />
          First day! The anticipation of the start of a new adventure, the first
          steps in a career completely different from anything I had done here,
          creates an tingling like I haven't felt in many years. <br /><br />
          Having the exact notion that this is the opportunity of a lifetime,
          the anxiety to get started is enormous.
          <br /><br />
          At the age of 49 and a half, which is characterized by essentially
          never having been a happy and accomplished person on a professional
          level, the beginning of this adventure that is Web Development gives
          me the hope of finally doing something that I truly enjoy
          professionally.
          <br /><br />
          Who would have thought that on August 24, 2020, when I ended my
          driving shift, I was struggling atrociously with unimaginable and
          impossible to describe pain, to the point of having entered the
          emergency room at the hospital in Rotthalmünster with a pain level of
          10 out of 10 and being immediately hospitalized for 5 days just for
          pain control, it would be the only (very painful) part of a long stage
          of surgeries, pain, suffering, tears and a lot of frustration that
          would bring me here to this new adventure….
          <br /><br />
          …. Web Development.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-overview">
          February 10, 2023 <br /><br />
          8:45! -I turned on the computer, opened the Slack app to see if I had
          any relevant messages. I clicked on the link that takes me to the Zoom
          meeting.<br /><br />
          After some anticipation, the day finally arrived. This long journey of
          over a year has begun.<br /><br />
          New faces, new lives, new dynamics are about to enter my screen and
          who, throughout this learning that will take place online every day
          and week, will share this adventure with me.<br /><br />
          The first few hours are acquaintance, normal formalities.<br /><br />
          After introducing us to the Trainer who will accompany us on this
          adventure and after the first few minutes, something immediately jumps
          out, his calm manner (too calm) and somewhat disorganized with regard
          to the organization of thoughts shows that a lot of caffeine will be
          needed.<br /><br />
          With the day ending, there was some skepticism towards the
          trainer...<br /><br />
          ...as the week went on, my fears about the trainer's way of teaching
          were confirmed. He is definitely a know-it-all, but his peculiar way
          of teaching very slow and a little disorganized is creating serious
          concentration problems for me.<br /><br />
          It took us two days on a topic that should have been covered in one
          morning, frustration starts to get the better of me and we're still on
          the third day of training. I notice that the disgust with this
          situation is reflected in some other training colleagues. I confess
          that I am a very patient person with people, but inexplicably it is
          not like that, I feel frustrated because I expected much more
          (dynamics) and I fear that if it continues at this pace it will
          certainly not be an easy year…<br /><br />
          ...Friday, Soft Skills day. But what a breath of fresh air this day
          was. Dynamic, cheerful, with a lot of interaction between everyone and
          very, very interesting and enriching in terms of personal and
          collective knowledge.<br /><br />
          The Coach knew how to captivate us for this session from the first
          moment. Compared to the previous days, it was like a huge and
          much-needed decompression. I deeply regret that we are only presented
          with the presence of this Coach for two sessions.
        </p>

        <h1 class="blog-title">week of contradictions</h1>
        <img src="./Images/Blog_3.png" class="blog-image" alt="" />

        <p class="blog-overview">
          <strong>February 13, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day. We are working on creating a code of
          conduct that will guide us throughout this training year. <br /><br />
          The way in which the topic was addressed throughout the morning was
          undoubtedly very interesting and constructive.<br /><br />
          During the afternoon we had the pleasure of having a different Basic
          Digital Literacy trainer who demonstrated, at least for me, what I
          have been thinking about teaching our resident trainer……<br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          <strong>February 14, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          …. the day got off to a bad start, really bad to tell you the truth,
          our resident coach came back and with him the disorganized
          teaching.<br /><br />
          It is not possible to try to teach commands in the “terminal” and not
          know what to respond to unforeseen situations.<br /><br />
          At one point, I lost my temper and was very direct in expressing my
          frustration with the matter.<br /><br />
          I should have had a different attitude, it wasn&#39;t good on my part
          and after the break I asked to speak in front of everyone, apologizing
          to the coach and other colleagues. <br /><br />
          I realized that my learning ambitions do not match the slow and
          disorganized way we are experiencing in this course, but obviously I
          will have to adapt to these conditions, so I will remain discreet for
          the sake of my path in this course and the well-being of other
          colleagues ...
          <br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 15, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          ,,, The day started strange and some people in the group started to
          feel the same frustration that I felt from the beginning.
          <br /><br />
          During the morning break, some people in the group decided to question
          the trainer about his way of teaching. I chose to turn off the camera
          and sound, I promised myself I&#39;ll keep a low profile, and I will.
          <br /><br />
          After resuming the class, things evolved in a more fluid way, I hope I
          can finally start talking here about everything that has to do with
          the Web Development course and nothing about everything else.
          <br /><br />
          We are essentially talking about the terminal installation of
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> There were some problems
          with the way it was demonstrated in class, personally I opted for a
          different and more effective approach, using different commands than
          those used in class…
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>source ~/.bashrc</li>
          <li>nvm list-remote</li>
          <li>
            nvm install v18.14.0
            <strong>
              in V18.14.0 you replace with the latest version or the one you
              want from the list presented in the previous command</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>nvm lts/hydrogen installation</li>
          <li>node -v</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />with the last command should appear .....<br /><br />
        <br /><br />18.14.0<br /><br />
        <br /><br />After....<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>npm install -g npm@9.4.2</li>
          <li>sudo apt install rpm</li>
        </ul>
        Thereby keeping &quot;node.js&quot; and &quot;npm&quot; installed and
        updated<br /><br />
        In the afternoon the theme was centered on the “rpm” command<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>npm init</li>
          <li>code .</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />It is<br /><br />
        Install an “npm” package. Check if and where this package has been
        installed. What command was used to check if and where the package was
        installed?<br /><br />
        A way to test commands in the terminal.<br /><br />
        At the end we did an evaluation<br /><br />
        <br /><br /><strong>February 16, 2023</strong><br /><br />
        It was an interesting day dedicated to “Git”<br /><br />
        <strong>What is Git?</strong><br /><br />
        Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
        designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
        speed and efficiency.<br /><br />
        After that, we start its installation and start using basic commands for
        your use…
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>sudo apt-get install git</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        After installing it, start your terminal and type the following command
        to verify that Git is ready to be used on your computer:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git –version</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        In your terminal, run the following commands to identify yourself with
        Git:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;</li>
          <li>git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.com&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        To create a new repository and start tracking your project with Git, use
        your terminal
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git init</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        This is a command that is very often used when working with Git. It
        shows us which files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git status</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br /><strong>staging files</strong><br /><br />
        From the project folder, we can use the git add command to add our files
        to the staging area, which allows them to be tracked. We can add a
        specific file to the staging area with the following command:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git add file.js</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />o add multiple files, we can do this:<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git add file.js file2.js file3.js</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        Instead of having to add the files individually, we can also add all the
        files inside the project folder to the staging area:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git add .</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        By default, this adds all the files and folders inside the project
        folder to the staging area, from where they are ready to be committed
        and tracked.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Making commits</strong><br /><br />
        A commit is a snapshot of our code at a particular time, which we are
        saving to the commit history of our repository. After adding all the
        files that we want to track to the staging area with the
        <strong>git add</strong> command, we are ready to make a commit.
        <br /><br />
        To commit the files from the staging area, we use the following command:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        Inside the quotes, we should write a commit message which is used to
        identify it in the commit history.
        <br /><br />
        The commit message should be a descriptive summary of the changes you
        are committing to the repository.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Branching</strong><br /><br />
        Whenever we initialize a folder as a repository, there will be one
        default branch (typically called master).
        <br /><br />
        We can create a branch that is a copy of (usually) the main branch. Then
        you can add your changes to this branch without affecting the main
        branch.
        <br /><br /><strong>Creating a new branch</strong><br /><br />
        You can create a new branch using the following command:<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>merging branches</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        Once we create a branch from master, they start living separate lives so
        to say. We don&#39;t want this to continue for too long, because it will
        become harder and harder to bring the two together.
        <br /><br />
        For example, after you fully implemented and tested a new feature in
        your code, you would want to merge those changes to the stable branch of
        your project (which is usually the default master branch). To merge the
        changes from a different branch into your current branch, you can use
        this command:
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>git merge "branch-name"</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />t was a good day of learning...<br /><br />
        <br /><br /><strong>February 17, 2023</strong><br /><br />
        <em>soft skills day</em>
        <br /><br />
        Once again it was an interesting day where we focused on communication
        and feelings.<br /><br />
        We focus on “Communications Square - Friedemann Schulz von Thun” in
        <em>“Appreciative communication”</em><br /><br />
        In another topic we talk about the topic: non-violent communication
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>what we are feeling</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        The big difference goal: learn to differentiate own feelings from
        interpretation, diagnoses, thoughts
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Universal Needs</li>
        </ul>
