          February 7, 2023 <br /><br />
          First day! The anticipation of the start of a new adventure, the first
          steps in a career completely different from anything I had done here,
          creates an tingling like I haven't felt in many years. <br /><br />
          Having the exact notion that this is the opportunity of a lifetime,
          the anxiety to get started is enormous.
          <br /><br />
          At the age of 49 and a half, which is characterized by essentially
          never having been a happy and accomplished person on a professional
          level, the beginning of this adventure that is Web Development gives
          me the hope of finally doing something that I truly enjoy
          professionally.
          <br /><br />
          Who would have thought that on August 24, 2020, when I ended my
          driving shift, I was struggling atrociously with unimaginable and
          impossible to describe pain, to the point of having entered the
          emergency room at the hospital in Rotthalmünster with a pain level of
          10 out of 10 and being immediately hospitalized for 5 days just for
          pain control, it would be the only (very painful) part of a long stage
          of surgeries, pain, suffering, tears and a lot of frustration that
          would bring me here to this new adventure….
          <br /><br />
          …. Web Development.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-overview">
          February 10, 2023 <br /><br />
          8:45! -I turned on the computer, opened the Slack app to see if I had
          any relevant messages. I clicked on the link that takes me to the Zoom
          meeting.<br /><br />
          After some anticipation, the day finally arrived. This long journey of
          over a year has begun.<br /><br />
          New faces, new lives, new dynamics are about to enter my screen and
          who, throughout this learning that will take place online every day
          and week, will share this adventure with me.<br /><br />
          The first few hours are acquaintance, normal formalities.<br /><br />
          After introducing us to the Trainer who will accompany us on this
          adventure and after the first few minutes, something immediately jumps
          out, his calm manner (too calm) and somewhat disorganized with regard
          to the organization of thoughts shows that a lot of caffeine will be
          needed.<br /><br />
          With the day ending, there was some skepticism towards the
          trainer...<br /><br />
          ...as the week went on, my fears about the trainer's way of teaching
          were confirmed. He is definitely a know-it-all, but his peculiar way
          of teaching very slow and a little disorganized is creating serious
          concentration problems for me.<br /><br />
          It took us two days on a topic that should have been covered in one
          morning, frustration starts to get the better of me and we're still on
          the third day of training. I notice that the disgust with this
          situation is reflected in some other training colleagues. I confess
          that I am a very patient person with people, but inexplicably it is
          not like that, I feel frustrated because I expected much more
          (dynamics) and I fear that if it continues at this pace it will
          certainly not be an easy year…<br /><br />
          ...Friday, Soft Skills day. But what a breath of fresh air this day
          was. Dynamic, cheerful, with a lot of interaction between everyone and
          very, very interesting and enriching in terms of personal and
          collective knowledge.<br /><br />
          The Coach knew how to captivate us for this session from the first
          moment. Compared to the previous days, it was like a huge and
          much-needed decompression. I deeply regret that we are only presented
          with the presence of this Coach for two sessions.

          <strong>February 13, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day. We are working on creating a code of
          conduct that will guide us throughout this training year. <br /><br />
          The way in which the topic was addressed throughout the morning was
          undoubtedly very interesting and constructive.<br /><br />
          During the afternoon we had the pleasure of having a different Basic
          Digital Literacy trainer who demonstrated, at least for me, what I
          have been thinking about teaching our resident trainer……<br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          <strong>February 14, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          …. the day got off to a bad start, really bad to tell you the truth,
          our resident coach came back and with him the disorganized
          teaching.<br /><br />
          It is not possible to try to teach commands in the “terminal” and not
          know what to respond to unforeseen situations.<br /><br />
          At one point, I lost my temper and was very direct in expressing my
          frustration with the matter.<br /><br />
          I should have had a different attitude, it wasn&#39;t good on my part
          and after the break I asked to speak in front of everyone, apologizing
          to the coach and other colleagues. <br /><br />
          I realized that my learning ambitions do not match the slow and
          disorganized way we are experiencing in this course, but obviously I
          will have to adapt to these conditions, so I will remain discreet for
          the sake of my path in this course and the well-being of other
          colleagues ...

          <p id="Node-js"><strong> February 15, 2023</strong><br /><br /></p>
          ,,, The day started strange and some people in the group started to
          feel the same frustration that I felt from the beginning.
          <br /><br />
          During the morning break, some people in the group decided to question
          the trainer about his way of teaching. I chose to turn off the camera
          and sound, I promised myself I&#39;ll keep a low profile, and I will.
          <br /><br />
          After resuming the class, things evolved in a more fluid way, I hope I
          can finally start talking here about everything that has to do with
          the Web Development course and nothing about everything else.
          <br /><br />
          We are essentially talking about the terminal installation of
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> There were some problems
          with the way it was demonstrated in class, personally I opted for a
          different and more effective approach, using different commands than
          those used in class…

          <ul>
            <li>source ~/.bashrc</li>
            <li>nvm list-remote</li>
            <li>
              nvm install v18.14.0
              <strong>
                in V18.14.0 you replace with the latest version or the one you
                want from the list presented in the previous command</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>nvm lts/hydrogen installation</li>
            <li>node -v</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />with the last command should appear .....<br /><br />
          <br /><br />18.14.0<br /><br />
          <br /><br />After....<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>npm install -g npm@9.4.2</li>
            <li>sudo apt install rpm</li>
          </ul>
          Thereby keeping &quot;node.js&quot; and &quot;npm&quot; installed and
          updated<br /><br />
          In the afternoon the theme was centered on the “rpm” command<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>npm init</li>
            <li>code .</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />It is<br /><br />
          Install an “npm” package. Check if and where this package has been
          installed. What command was used to check if and where the package was
          installed?<br /><br />
          A way to test commands in the terminal.<br /><br />
          At the end we did an evaluation<br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 16, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day dedicated to “Git”<br /><br />
          <p id="git"><strong>What is Git?</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
          designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
          speed and efficiency.<br /><br />
          After that, we start its installation and start using basic commands
          for your use…
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-installation">sudo apt-get install git</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          After installing it, start your terminal and type the following
          command to verify that Git is ready to be used on your computer:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-version">git –version</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          In your terminal, run the following commands to identify yourself with
          Git:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-config">
              git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;
            </li>
            <li>git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.com&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          To create a new repository and start tracking your project with Git,
          use your terminal
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-init">git init</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          This is a command that is very often used when working with Git. It
          shows us which files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="the-git-status">git status</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <p id="staging-files"><strong>staging files</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          From the project folder, we can use the git add command to add our
          files to the staging area, which allows them to be tracked. We can add
          a specific file to the staging area with the following command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-add-1-file">git add [filename]</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />o add multiple files, we can do this:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-add-multi-file">
              git add [filename.1] [filename.2] [filename.3]
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Instead of having to add the files individually, we can also add all
          the files inside the project folder to the staging area:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-add-all-file">git add .</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          By default, this adds all the files and folders inside the project
          folder to the staging area, from where they are ready to be committed
          and tracked.
          <br /><br />
          <p id="making-commits"><strong>Making commits</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          A commit is a snapshot of our code at a particular time, which we are
          saving to the commit history of our repository. After adding all the
          files that we want to track to the staging area with the
          <strong>git add</strong> command, we are ready to make a commit.
          <br /><br />
          To commit the files from the staging area, we use the following
          command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Inside the quotes, we should write a commit message which is used to
          identify it in the commit history.
          <br /><br />
          The commit message should be a descriptive summary of the changes you
          are committing to the repository.
          <br /><br />
          <p id="branching"><strong>Branching</strong></p>
          <br /><br />
          Git branching allows developers to diverge from the production version
          of code to fix a bug or add a feature. Developers create branches to
          work with a copy of the code without modifying the existing
          version.<br /><br />
          You create branches to isolate your code changes, which you test
          before merging to the main branch Whenever we initialize a folder as a
          repository, there will be one default branch (typically called
          master).
          <br /><br />
          We can create a branch that is a copy of (usually) the main branch.
          Then you can add your changes to this branch without affecting the
          main branch.
          <br /><br /><strong>Creating a new branch</strong><br /><br />
          You can create a new branch using the following command:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="merging-branches">merging branches</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Once we create a branch from master, they start living separate lives
          so to say. We don&#39;t want this to continue for too long, because it
          will become harder and harder to bring the two together.
          <br /><br />
          For example, after you fully implemented and tested a new feature in
          your code, you would want to merge those changes to the stable branch
          of your project (which is usually the default master branch). To merge
          the changes from a different branch into your current branch, you can
          use this command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li id="git-marge">git merge "branch-name"</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />t was a good day of learning...<br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 17, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          <p id="soft-skills-1"><em>soft skills day</em></p>
          <br /><br />
          Once again it was an interesting day where we focused on communication
          and feelings.<br /><br />
          We focus on “Communications Square - Friedemann Schulz von Thun” in
          <em>“Appreciative communication”</em><br /><br />
          In another topic we talk about the topic: non-violent communication
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>what we are feeling</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          The big difference goal: learn to differentiate own feelings from
          interpretation, diagnoses, thoughts
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Universal Needs</li>
          </ul>

            A new week will start with a different Teacher, but who has already
            been with us before and with a teaching style that pleases.

          <p>
            We&#39;ve covered <strong>&quot;git&quot;</strong> and

          <br />
          <p>
            Was created by Linus Torvalds to track changes to a project from
            multiple authors
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Who likes the idea of travelling through time?</h2>
          <br />

          <p>GIT is a way to travel through time for your project!</p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
          <br />
          <p>GIT is a command line tool</p>
          <p>We use GIT to keep track of changes to files</p>
          <p>
            We can travel through those changes and see how a project appeared
            earlier in time

          <p>
            GIT <strong>does not automatically</strong> add your changes,
            <strong>until you tell it to</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            GIT will keep track of any file changes after you&#39;ve used
            <strong>git add</strong> to track them
          </p>
          <p>
            Each change or set of changes are recorded within the GIT repository
            as a <strong>commit</strong>
          </p>

            When configuring GIT, this has nothing to do with your GitHub
            account
          </p>
          <p>There is no such thing as a &quot;GIT account&quot;</p>

            anything you like
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2 id="local-remote-repositories">Local and remote repositories</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Local = anything that is available locally on your machine Remote =
            a repository which lives on a shared network resource
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>GitHub</strong> really shines here - the most post popular
            and easy to use remote GIT service
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>git remote -v</strong> - view the link to the remote
            repository
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can link to your remote repositories using either the
            <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocol or the <strong>SSH</strong> protocol
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3 id="https">HTTPS</h3>
          <br />

          <p>
            Using <strong>HTTPS</strong> means that every time you want to
            interact with your remote repository, you have to enter your
            username and password
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3>
          <br />

          <p>Secure Shell</p>
          <p>
            Before you can use <strong>SSH</strong>, you have to generate an
            <strong>SSH</strong> key - which will automatically be used when you
            interact with your remote repository
          </p>
          <p>
            More work to setup to setup at the start, but saves you time
            compared to HTTPS
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you make changes to the homepage - when you make
            your commit for the homepage, it should only include those changes
            for the homepage
          </p>

              commit with <strong>git add</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>git add .</strong> - adds everything

            <strong>git push</strong> - sends new commits to the
            <strong>remote repository</strong>. Only sends commits!
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Any changes outside of a commit are NOT sent (pushed) to the

            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>git pull</strong> - pulls changes from the
            <strong>remote repository</strong> to the
            <strong>local repository</strong>
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you have any uncommitted changes,

            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>git fetch</strong> - ask the remote, have any new branches

          <h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Within your repository, you can have multiple versions of the code
            you are working on
          </p>
          <p>
            Most repositories will have a <strong>main</strong> or
            <strong>master</strong> branch, which represents the up-to-date
            version of the application.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              When you&#39;re working in a team, if everybody commits to the
              same branch - it gets messy very quickly, because you are dealing
              with multiple commits and some of these commits may override each
              other (merge conflict)
            </li>
            <li>
              What if you make a mistake? What if you break the code? Working in
              a separate branch means your code is isolated from the rest of the
              team - any faults would be contained.

          <p>
            ,,, Today we start a new Module
            <em><strong>&quot;User Interface Basic&quot;</strong></em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard language used to
            create the structure and content of web pages. HTML provides a basic
            user interface for displaying text, images, and other media on the
            internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of user interface, HTML provides the building blocks for
            creating interactive elements like buttons, forms, and menus. These
            elements can be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create
            a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML also provides the ability to include hyperlinks, which allow
            users to navigate between pages and websites. This is an essential
            aspect of the user interface as it enables users to access the
            information they are looking for quickly and efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, HTML provides the foundation for creating a user-friendly
            and interactive web interface. By using HTML along with CSS and
            other programming languages, developers can create complex web
            applications and websites that are easy to use and navigate.

            It was a day dedicated to reviewing all the information we had the
            day before with some exercises to assimilate these teachings.
          </p>
          <p>
            There continue to be some difficulties (more confusion than
            difficulties) about branches and commits.

            Day dedicated to Soft Skills with the theme
            <em><strong>&quot;Intercultural Competences&quot;</strong></em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>But what are <em>Intercultural Competences?</em></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Intercultural competences refer to the ability to understand,
            communicate, and interact effectively with people from different
            cultures. It involves the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to
            navigate diverse cultural settings and to build positive
            relationships with people from different backgrounds.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Some common intercultural competences include:</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Cultural awareness: having an understanding of one&#39;s own
            cultural background and being open to learning about other cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication skills: being able to communicate effectively with
            people from different cultures, including the ability to listen
            actively, ask questions, and provide feedback.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Flexibility and adaptability: being able to adjust one&#39;s
            behavior and communication style to fit different cultural contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy: being able to understand and appreciate the perspectives
            and experiences of people from different cultures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Conflict resolution skills: being able to resolve conflicts that may
            arise in intercultural interactions, including the ability to
            negotiate, compromise, and find mutually acceptable solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing intercultural competences is becoming increasingly
            important in our globalized world, where people from different
            cultures are increasingly working and living together.

        <p>
          A new week will start with a new Teacher and this time apparently
          permanent, I checked her corriculun on LinkedIn and it is impressive,
          I confess that for a first impression it surprises for the positive
          and with a didactic that pleases.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>We&#39;ve covered <strong>&quot;Classes and IDs&quot;</strong>...</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We start by talking about pages, the &quot;head&quot; section and the
          elements it contains
        </p>
        <p>
          To start we need make sure the starting page is called
          <strong><em>index.html</em></strong> otherwise the server will not
          recognize it and you will see a bunch of files and directories
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>In order to add internal styles we use the style tag</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>inline css <strong>(highest priority 1)</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to add inline style we use the style ATTRIB</li>

            ><code
              >&lt;h1 style=&quot;background-color: lightblue&quot;&gt;Classes

            ></em
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          We have seen how to style an element using the general selector (eg.
          h1, p etc..) We can also select elments using <em>classes</em> and
          <em>IDs</em>
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="what-is-classes">What is Classes?</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The <strong><em>class</em></strong> attribute specifies one or more
          class names for an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes are used by <em>CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em> to select and
          access specific elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The class attribute can be used on any <strong>HTML element</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The class name is <strong><em>case sensitive</em></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.</p>
        <p>
          We can applying multiple classes to the same element In the example
          below &quot;redBg&quot; and &quot;white&quot; are 2 different classes.
        </p>
        <p>We need to make sure you leave a space between them.</p>
        <p>
          <br />

          *<code>
            &lt;p&gt; class=&quot;redBg greenBg white&quot;&gt;Multiple
            classes&lt;/p&gt;</code
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="what-is-ids">What is IDs?</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The HTML <em>id</em> attribute is used to specify a
          <strong><em>unique id for an HTML element</em></strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value
          of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The id attribute is used to point to a
          <em>specific style declaration</em> in a style sheet. It is also used
          by <em>JavaScript</em> to access and manipulate the element with the
          specific id.
        </p>
        <p>
          The syntax for id is: write a hash character
          <strong><em>(#)</em></strong
          >, followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within
          curly braces {}.
        </p>

        <h2 id="links-and-pseudo-classes">Links and pseudo classes</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          A website is made up by several pages. In order to jump from one page
          to the other we use links
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="link-features">Link features</h2>
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>An unvisited link is blue and underlined</li>
          <li>An visited link is underlined and purple</li>
          <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2 id="link-in-action">Link in action</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          To create a link use the &quot;a&quot; tag href is a very important
          attribute. It describes the link destination
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            INTERNAL LINK An internal link points to a page within your project
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>
          <code
            >&lt;p&gt;To go to the about page click &lt;a
            href=&quot;aboutPage.html&quot;&gt; HERE &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            EXTERNAL LINK Points you to a page located elsewhere.. outside of
            your project/domain
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>

          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          MAKE SURE external links open in a new tab by using the TARGET
          attribute
        </p>
        <br />

        <br />

        <h2><em>March 1, 2023</em></h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          ,,, Today we start with
          <strong><em>&quot;Selectors and combinators&quot;</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p id="combinators">CSS <em>Combinators</em></p>
        <br />

        <p>
          A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the
          selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the
          simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>There are four different combinators in CSS:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>descendant selector (space)</li>
          <li>child selector (&gt;)</li>
          <li>adjacent sibling selector (+)</li>
          <li>general sibling selector (~)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2 id="descendant-selector">Descendant Selector</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a
          specified element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example selects all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements
          inside <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code> `&lt;section&gt;
    
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p><em>DESCENDANT (space)</em></p>
        <pre><code>`h2 span { /_ selects a span inside an h2 (loose) _/
    
    color: cadetblue;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 30px;
    background-color: white;
    
    }`
    </code></pre>
        <br />

        <h2 id="child-selector">Child Selector (&gt;)</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a
          specified element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements that
          are children of a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code> `&lt;section&gt;
    
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;this is paragraph 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <br />

        <pre><code>`section &gt; p { /* selects a p that is an immediate child of section */
    
    border: 5px dashed green;
    }`
    </code></pre>
        <br />

        <h2 id="adjacent-sibling-selector">Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is
          directly after another specific element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and
          &quot;adjacent&quot; means &quot;immediately following&quot;.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The following example selects the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element
          that are placed immediately after <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`&lt;div&gt;I am Div&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;I am the first p following a div&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am the second p following a div &lt;/p&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>
          <br />

          <strong><em>CSS</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`div + p { /* The FIRST p coming IMMEDIATELY AFTER a div will be selected */
    
    background-color: orange;
    }`
    </code></pre>
        <br />

        <h2 id="general-sibling-selector">General Sibling Selector (~)</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next
          siblings of a specified element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example selects all <code>&lt;purple&gt;</code> class,
          elements that are next siblings of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements:
        </p>
        <br />

          <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>
        </p>
        <pre><code>`&lt;div class=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;All ul after me will have a purple background&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;item 3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;item 4&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;`
    </code></pre>
        <p>

        <p id="css-units">
          It was a day dedicated to <em><strong>Css Units</strong></em>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Css units are important for setting dimensions (height, width, margin
          etc..)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>CSS has several different units for expressing a length.</p>
        <p>
          <br />
          Many CSS properties take <strong>&quot;length&quot;</strong> values,
          such as <em>width</em>, <em>margin</em>, <em>padding</em>,
          <em>font-size</em>, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> A whitespace cannot appear between the number
          and the unit. However, if the value is <em><strong>0</strong></em
          >, the unit can be omitted.
        </p>
        <p>For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.</p>
        <br />
        <p>There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.</p>
        <br />

        <h2>Absolute unit (Pixel) - keeps the same size at all times</h2>
        <br />

        <em><strong> Pixel </strong></em><br />

        <div id="dimensions-in-px">Dimensions set in Px</div>

        <em><strong> Pixels pros and cons </strong></em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            px
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pixels will always look the same across all devices (mobile
                desktop, tablet)
              </li>
              <li>PRO: easy to work with</li>
              <li>CONS: Not good for responsive design</li>
              <li>CONS: Px override user's preference (browser)</li>
              <li>TIP: Never set font-size in PX</li>
              <li>
                USAGE: px for minor adjustments (shadows, borders and specific
                things)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <h2 id="relative-units">Relative units</h2>
        <br />

        <h3>Percentage % (relative to its immediate parent)</h3>

        <div>25%</div>
        <br />

        <em
          ><strong>

                the parent has a hight set in px.
              </li>
              <li>PRO - useful for building layouts that shrink and grow</li>
              <li>
                CONS - You might have excessive shrinkage so use it in combo
                with max-width and min-width
              </li>
              <li>USAGE - Large layout concerns</li>

        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>"em"</strong> is a bit special and we have to bear in mind
          that the values are relative to the font-size of element
          <strong>(2em means 2 times more the size of the corrent font)</strong>

      <p>
        In order to add images we need to add an img tag The image tag has 2
        required attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>src - specifies the path</li>
        <li>
          alt - specifies text to display in case the image can't be loaded
          (important for SEO & accessibility)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong
          >If we add an image without style the image will have its natural

      <h2 id="two-ways-of-setting-image-size">
        there are 2 ways of setting image size
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          width/height attribute is always intended in px. Do not specify unit.
        </li>
        <li>
          we can specify width/height in the css as well in that case we can use
          any unit
        </li>
        <li>
          try to specify 1 dimension only in order to preserve aspect-ratio

      <h2 id="images-issues">Image issues</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        It is not good practice to use height and width because if we do not
        know exactly the measurements of the image it will be deformed, this
        will result in a squished image
      </p>

      <h2 id="images-links">Images as links</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        We can add image as a link and other HTML elements as a link. <br />
        A link is a connection from one Web page to another web page. <br />
        We can add page links to a web page. HTML links are hyperlinks. The
        &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink and used to link from one page to
        another.
        <br />
        href attribute is used with the &lt;a&gt; tag, which indicates the
        link's destination.
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre><code>

      <h1 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h1>
      <br /><br />

      <p>
        Accessible design is that which accommodates everyone, which special
        attention to those with disabilities and limitations. We see
        accessibility baked into the world around us, from closed captioning to
        curb cuts. <br /><br />
        When it comes to accessibility on the web, however, we have a lot more
        work to do. According to a recent survey of screen reader users, 60% of
        respondents believed that overall web accessibility had either remained
        the same or had worsened since the previous year. <br /><br />
        The good news is that, with a bit of extra care taken on the back-end,
        any website can be made accessible to users of assistive technologies
        like screen readers. By investing in web accessibility, not only do you
        ensure a positive user experience for everyone — you also show your
        visitors that you care about equal access to your content. And it all
        starts with taking a look at your site’s underlying HTML. <br /><br />
        In this guide, you’ll learn the basics of how to build a web page that
        works with assistive technologies — we’ll review six aspects of HTML
        that make this possible. For those unfamiliar with web development, we
        recommend first reviewing our introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        as well as our full guide to HTML, before continuing
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Prefer semantic elements. <br />
        Use div and span only for layout purposes
      </p>
      <br />

      <section>
        <h2>heading in subsequent order</h2>
        <br />
        <h2>Main section title</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Second level title</h3>
      </section>
      <br />

      <h2>the next sectino can still start from h2</h2>
      <br />
      <section>
        <h2>Main section title</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Second level title</h3>
        <br />
      </section>

      <h2 id="aria-label">Aria label</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        an aria label is an attribute used as a label to define the current
        element <br />
        it is used on interactive elements (buttons, links etc.. )
      </p>
      <br />

      <button>X</button><br />

      <p>the only thing accessible to the screen reader is the X</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;button aria-label="Close popup">X &lt;/button&gt;

      </code></pre>
      <br />

      <h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are not using semantic elements you can still add roles to them
        to make them more accessible
      </p>

      <p>imagine we have a link that acts like a button (legacy code)</p>
      <br />

      <pre><code>
        &lt;a href="#">Delete&lt;/a&gt;

      </code></pre>
      <br />

      <p>
        In this case we are using a link for a functionality that belongs to a
        button. Add a role to make it accessible.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        &lt;a href="#" role="button" aria-label="delete item 1">Delete&lt;a&gt;
  
        </code></pre>
      <br />

      <p>
        The role can also be applied to non semantic tags in order to make them
        accessible
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        &lt;div role="navigation"&gt;

      <h2 id="block_and_inline_boxes">Block and inline boxes</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the
        categories of <strong>block boxes</strong> and
        <strong>inline boxes</strong>. The type refers to how the box behaves in
        terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes
        have an <strong>inner display type</strong> and an
        <strong>outer display type</strong>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In general, you can set various values for the display type using the
        display property, which can have various values.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 id="outer_display_type">Outer display type</h2>
      <br />
      <p>If a box has an outer display type of <code>block</code>, then:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The box will break onto a new line.</li>
        <li>
          The
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>width</code></a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>height</code></a
          >
          properties are respected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away
          from the box.
        </li>
        <li>
          If width is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction
          to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box
          will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space
          available.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some HTML elements, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, use <code>block</code> as their outer display
        type by default.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>If a box has an outer display type of <code>inline</code>, then:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
        <li>The width and height properties will not apply.</li>
        <li>
          Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause
          other inline boxes to move away from the box.
        </li>
        <li>
          Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause
          other inline boxes to move away from the box.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>
        Some HTML elements, such as <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> use <code>inline</code> as their outer
        display type by default.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 id="inner_display_type">Inner display type</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        Boxes also have an <em>inner</em> display type, which dictates how
        elements inside that box are laid out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Block and inline layout is the default way things behave on the web. By
        default and without any other instruction, the elements inside a box are
        also laid out in
        <strong
          ><a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow"
            target="_blank"
            >normal flow</a
          ></strong
        >
        and behave as block or inline boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change the inner display type for example by setting
        <code>display: flex;</code>. The element will still use the outer
        display type <code>block</code> but this changes the inner display type
        to <code>flex</code>. Any direct children of this box will become flex
        items and behave according to the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox"
          target="_blank"
          >Flexbox</a
        >
        specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you move on to learn about CSS Layout in more detail, you will
        encounter flex, and various other inner values that your boxes can have,
        for example
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids"
          target="_blank"
          ><code>grid</code></a
        >.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> To read more about the values of display, and how
        boxes work in block and inline layout, take a look at the MDN guide

      <h2 id="examples_of_different_display_types">
        Examples of different display types
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The example below has three different HTML elements, all of which have
        an outer display type of <code>block</code>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a
          block box. The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire
          available width.
        </li>
        <li>
          A list, which is laid out using <code>display: flex</code>. This
          establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are
          flex items. The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph —
          expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.
        </li>
        <li>
          A block-level paragraph, inside which are two
          <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. These elements would normally be
          <code>inline</code>, however, one of the elements has a class of
          "block" which gets set to <code>display: block</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="1000rem"
        height="1100"
        src="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/box-model/block.html"
        loading="lazy"
      ></iframe
      ><br />

      <p>
        In the next example, we can see how <code>inline</code> elements behave.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements in the first paragraph are
          inline by default and so do not force line breaks.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element that is set to
          <code>display: inline-flex</code> creates an inline box containing
          some flex items.
        </li>
        <li>
          The two paragraphs are both set to <code>display: inline</code>. The
          inline flex container and paragraphs all run together on one line
          rather than breaking onto new lines (as they would do if they were
          displaying as block-level elements).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >To toggle between the display modes, you can change
          <code>display: inline</code> to <code>display: block</code> or
          <code>display: inline-flex</code> to <code>display: flex</code>.
          <br /><br />
        </strong>
      </p>
      <iframe
        width="1000rem"
        height="1100"
        src="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/learn/box-model/inline.html"
        loading="lazy"
      ></iframe
      ><br />

      <p>
        The key thing to remember for now is: Changing the value of the
        <code>display</code> property can change whether the outer display type
        of a box is block or inline. This changes the way it displays alongside
        other elements in the layout.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 id="what_is_the_css_box_model">What is the CSS box model?</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        The CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the
        different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work
        together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use
        just <em>some</em> of the behavior defined in the box model.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model. By
        default, browsers use the standard box model.
      </p>
      <h3 id="parts_of_a_box">Parts of a box</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Making up a block box in CSS we have the:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Content box</strong>: The area where your content is
          displayed; size it using properties like
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inline-size"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>inline-size</code></a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>block-size</code></a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>width</code></a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>height</code></a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Padding box</strong>: The padding sits around the content as
          white space; size it using
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>padding</code></a
          >
          and related properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Border box</strong>: The border box wraps the content and any
          padding; size it using
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>border</code></a
          >
          and related properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Margin box</strong>: The margin is the outermost layer,
          wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this
          box and other elements; size it using
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin"
            target="_blank"
            ><code>margin</code></a

      <h1 id="semantic-elements">Semantic elements</h1>

      <p>
        With over 100 HTML elements, and the ability to create custom elements,
        there are infinite ways to mark up your content; but some ways—notably
        <em>semantically</em>—are better than others.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <em>Semantic</em> means "relating to meaning". Writing semantic HTML
        means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each
        element's meaning, not its appearance.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        This series hasn't covered many HTML elements yet, but even without
        knowing HTML, the following two code snippets show how semantic markup
        can give content context. Both use a word count instead of
        <em>ipsum lorem</em> to save some scrolling—use your imagination to
        expand "thirty words" into 30 words:
      </p>

      <p>
        The first code snippet uses <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, two elements with no semantic value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which code block conveyed meaning? Using only the non-semantic elements
        of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, you really
        can't tell what the content in the first code block represents. The
        second code example, with semantic elements, provides enough context for
        a non-coder to decipher the purpose and meaning without having ever
        encountered an HTML tag. It definitely provides enough context for the
        developer to understand the outline of the page, even if they don't
        understand the content, such as content in a foreign language.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In the second code block, we can understand the architecture even
        without understanding the content because semantic elements provide
        meaning and structure. You can tell that the first header is the site's
        banner, with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> likely to be the site name. The
        footer is the site footer: the five words may be a copyright statement
        or business address.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Semantic markup isn't just about making markup easier for developers to
        read; it's mostly about making markup easy for automated tools to
        decipher. Developer tools demonstrate how semantic elements provide
        machine-readable structure as well.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 id="accessibility-object-model-aom">
        Accessibility object model (AOM)
      </h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        As the browser parses the content received, it builds the document
        object model (DOM) and the CSS object model (CSSOM). It then also builds
        an accessibility tree. Assistive devices, such as screen readers, use
        the AOM to parse and interpret content. The DOM is a tree of all the
        nodes in the document. The AOM is like a semantic version of the DOM.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Use semantic landmarks conveniently named
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for
        "navigation". Landmarks provide structure to web content and ensure
        important sections of content are easily keyboard navigable for screen
        reader users.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Note that <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> are landmarks, with the roles of
        <code>banner</code> and <code>contentinfo</code> respectively, when they
        are not nested in other landmarks.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Looking at Chrome developer tools, you'll note a significant difference
        between the accessibility object model when using semantic elements
        versus when you don't.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        It's pretty clear that semantic element usage helps accessibility, and
        using non-semantic elements reduces accessibility. HTML is generally, by
        default, accessible. Our job as developers is to both protect HTML's
        default accessible nature and ensure that we maximize accessibility. You
        can

      <br />

      <h2 id="semantic-elements-2">Semantic elements</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        Asking yourself, "Which element best represents the function of this
        section of markup?" will generally result in you picking the best
        element for the job. The element you choose, and therefore the tags you
        use, should be appropriate for the content you are displaying, as tags
        have semantic meaning.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        HTML should be used to structure content, not to define content's
        appearance. The appearance is the realm of CSS. While some elements are
        defined to appear a certain way, don't use an element based on how the
        user agent stylesheet makes that element appear by default. Rather,
        select each element based on the element's semantic meaning and
        functionality. Coding HTML in a logical, semantic, and meaningful way
        helps to ensure CSS is applied as intended.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Choosing the right elements for the job as you code means you won't have
        to refactor or comment your HTML. If you think about using the right
        element for the job, you'll most often pick the right element for the
        job. If you don't, you probably won't. When you understand the semantics
        of each element and are aware of why choosing the right element is
        important, you will generally be able to make the right choice without
        much additional effort.

      <h1>How to Implement a Background Image in HTML</h1>
      <br />

      <p>
        Adding a Background Image in HTML is one of the most common tasks when
        you are working on Web Designing. The following pointers will be covered
        in this article:
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 id="BackgroundImageinHTML">Background Image In HTML</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        There are various ways in which images can be added to a web page to
        make it look captivating &amp; appealing. One of such ways is adding
        background image. In this blog we will understand how we can add
        background images in a webpage using HTML &amp; CSS. The most common
        &amp; simple way to add background image is using the background image
        attribute inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <br />

      <pre>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;body background="edureka.png"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Edureka&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edureka.co"&gt;Edureka.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        The background attribute which we specified in the &lt;body&gt; tag is
        not supported in HTML5. Using CSS properties, we can also add background
        image in a webpage.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 id="CSSbackground-imageProperty">CSS background-image Property</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        In all the examples, we will be defining the CSS code inside the
        &lt;style&gt; tag. We will also look how to target div tag and class
        using CSS. In the below example, we are specifying the background-image
        &amp; background-color CSS property which will set the background image
        &amp; background property for the HTML body respectively.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Moving on with this article on Background Image In HTML</p>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <br />
      <pre>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;style&gt; 
      body {
        background-image: url("bg1.jpg");
        background-color: #cccccc;
      }
      &lt;/style&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Document Body&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
      
      </pre>
      You can also go ahead and add two background images for the &lt;body&gt;
      element.

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <br />

      <pre>
      body {
      background-image: url("bg3.png"), url("bg1.jpg");
      background-color: #cccccc;
      }
      </pre>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The background image by default is added to the left corner &amp; is
            repeated both ways, i.e. horizontally &amp; vertically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The reason why it is preferred to keep a background color is that if
            the image is unavailable, so the background-color property will be
            used and the same will be displayed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>
        Now before understanding how we can use different CSS property values,
        let’s look at the list of CSS property values associated with the
        background image.
      </p>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>url:</strong> URL to the background image. In case of more
          than one image, comma-separated list needs be provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>linear-gradient():</strong> Sets a linear gradient as the
          background image. Needs at least 2 colors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>radial-gradient():</strong> Sets a radial gradient as the
          background image. Needs at least 2 colors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>repeating-linear-gradient():</strong> Repeats a linear
          gradient
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>repeating-radial-gradient():</strong> Repeats a radial
          gradient
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>initial:</strong> Sets the property to its default value
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>inherit</strong>: Inherits this property from its parent
          element
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        In HTML
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let’s execute some of the examples to understand how to use CSS
        property values.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2 id="background-repeat">Background Repeat</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Here we are trying to add couple of background images wherein the first
        image will appear only one time and the second image will be repeated.
        We are using background-repeat to do so.
      </p>
      <br />
      <pre>
      
      body {
      background-image: url("bg2.jpg"), url("bg3.png");
      background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
      background-color: #cccccc;
      }

      <br />

      <h2 id="using-class">Using Class</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this example, we are creating bg-image with various background
        properties such as image, color, position &amp; repeat. We are targeting
        the bg-image class to apply the background properties to the webpage.
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre>
      body {
      margin: 0;
      font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
      }
      
      .bg-image {
      background-image: url("bg2.jpg");
      background-color: #cccccc;
      height: 500px;
      background-position: center;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: cover;
      position: relative;
      }
      
      .bg-text {
      text-align: center;
      position: absolute;
      top: 50%;
      left: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      color: white;
      }
      </pre>

      <h2 id="linear-gradient">Linear Gradient</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        Here we are creating a linear-gradient using two colors(i.e. red &amp;
        yellow) and setting it as the background image.
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre>
      #gradient {
        height: 200px;
        background-color: #cccccc;
        background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
      }
      </pre>

      <h2 id="color-gradient">3 Color Gradient</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Here we are creating a linear-gradient using three colors(i.e. red, blue
        &amp; green) and setting it as the background image.
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre>
      #gradient1 {
      height: 300px;
      background-color: #cccccc;

        image.
      </p>
      <br />

      #gradient1 {
      height: 300px;
      background-color: #cccccc;

      <h2 id="what-are-ux-and-ui-in-the-first-place">
        1. What are UX and UI in the first place?
      </h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >First things first: What do UX and UI actually mean?&nbsp;</strong
        >
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        UX design refers to the term "User experience design", while UI stands
        for "User interface design". Both elements are crucial to a product and
        work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the
        roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different
        aspects of the product development process and the design discipline.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Before considering the key differences between UX and UI, let’s first
        define what each term means individually.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3 id="what-is-user-experience-ux-design">
        What is user experience (UX) design?
      </h3>
      <br />

      <p>
        User experience design is a human-first way of designing products. Don
        Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the
        <strong>Norman Group Design Consultancy</strong>, is credited with
        coining the term “user experience” in the late 1990s. Here’s how he
        describes it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <br />
        <p>
          “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction
          with the company, its services, and its products.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>– Don Norman, Cognitive Scientist &amp; User Experience Architect</p>
      <p>
        Clear, right? Well, you might note immediately that despite what I
        implied in the introduction, the definition has no reference to tech, no
        mention of digital, and doesn’t tell us all that much about what a UX
        designer actually does. But like all professions, it’s impossible to
        distill the process from just a few words.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Still, Don Norman’s definition tells us that,
        <strong>regardless of its medium </strong>plenty of non-digital UX (and
        there are lots out there) UX Design encompasses any and all interactions
        between a potential or active customer and a company.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a scientific process, it could be applied to anything; street lamps,
        cars, Ikea shelving, and so on.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>The digital application of UX</h4>
      <br />

      <p>
        However, despite being a scientific term, its use since inception has
        been almost entirely within digital fields; one reason for this being
        that the tech industry started blowing up around the time of the term’s
        invention.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Essentially, UX applies to anything that can be experienced—be it a
        website, a coffee machine, or a visit to the supermarket. The “user
        experience” part refers to the interaction between the user and a
        product or service. User experience <em>design</em>, then, considers all
        the different elements that shape this experience.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>What does UX design involve?</h4>
      <br />

      <p>
        A UX designer thinks about how the experience makes the user feel and
        how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks. They also
        observe and conduct task analyses to see how users actually complete
        tasks in a user flow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example: How easy is the checkout process when shopping online? How
        easy is it for you to grip that vegetable peeler? Does your online
        banking app make it easy for you to manage your money?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The ultimate purpose of UX design is to create easy, efficient,
        relevant, and all-around pleasant experiences for the user.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We’ll answer the question “What does a UX designer do?” more thoroughly
        in section four. For now, here’s what you need to know about UX design
        in a nutshell:
      </p>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          User experience design is the process of developing and improving the
          quality of interaction between a user and all facets of a company.
        </li>
        <li>
          User experience design is, in theory, a non-digital (cognitive
          science) practice but used and defined predominantly by digital
          industries.
        </li>
        <li>
          UX design is NOT about visuals; it focuses on the overall feel of the
          experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h3 id="what-is-user-interface-ui-design">
        What is user interface (UI) design?
      </h3>
      <br />

      <p>
        Despite it being an older and more practiced field, the question “What
        is user interface design?” is difficult to answer because of its broad
        variety of misinterpretations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While user experience is a conglomeration of tasks focused on the
        optimization of a product for effective and enjoyable use, user
        interface design is its complement; the look and feel, the presentation
        and interactivity of a product.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But like UX, it is easily and often confused by the industries that
        employ UI designers—to the extent that different job posts will often
        refer to the profession as completely different things.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you look at job ads and job descriptions for user interface
        designers, you will mostly find interpretations of the profession that
        are akin to graphic design, sometimes extending also to branding design
        and even frontend development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you look at “expert” definitions of User Interface Design, you will
        mostly find descriptions that are in part identical to User Experience
        Design—even referring to the same structural techniques.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>So which one is right? The sad answer is: <strong>Neither.</strong></p>
      <br />
      <h4>The digital application of UI</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        So let’s set the record straight once and for all. Unlike UX, user
        interface design <strong>is</strong> a strictly digital term.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user interface is the point of interaction between the user and a
        digital device or product—like the touchscreen on your smartphone or the
        touchpad you use to select what kind of coffee you want from the coffee
        machine.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In relation to websites and apps, UI design considers the look, feel,
        and interactivity of the product. It’s all about making sure that the
        user interface of a product is as intuitive as possible, and that means
        carefully considering each and every visual, interactive element the
        user might encounter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A UI designer will think about icons and buttons, typography and color
        schemes, spacing, imagery, and responsive design.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>What does UI design involve</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Like user experience design, user interface design is a multi-faceted
        and challenging role. It is responsible for the transference of a
        product’s development, research, content, and layout into
        <strong
          >an attractive, guiding, and responsive experience for users.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We’ll look at the UI design process and specific tasks that a UI
        designer can expect in section four. Before we consider the main
        differences between UX and UI, let’s quickly recap on what user
        interface (UI) design is all about:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          User interface design is a purely digital practice. It considers all
          the visual, interactive elements of a product interface—including
          buttons, icons, spacing, typography, color schemes, and responsive
          design.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of UI design is to visually guide the user through a
          product’s interface. It’s all about creating an intuitive experience
          that doesn’t require the user to think too much!
        </li>
        <li>
          UI design transfers the brand’s strengths and visual assets to a
          product’s interface, making sure the design is consistent, coherent,
          and aesthetically pleasing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <p>
        Now we have a clear-cut definition of both UX and UI, let’s consider the
        key differences between the two.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-ux-and-ui-design">
        2. What’s the difference between UX and UI design?
      </h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        There’s an analogy I like to use to describe the different parts of a
        (digital) product:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you imagine a product as the human body, the bones represent the code
        that gives it structure. The organs represent the UX design: measuring
        and optimizing against input for supporting life functions. UI design
        represents the cosmetics of the body, its presentation, its senses, and
        reactions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>But don’t worry if you’re still confused! You’re not the only one!</p>
      <br />
      <p>As Rahul Varshney, co-creator of Foster.fm puts it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <br />

        <p>
          “User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most
          confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a
          painter slapping paint onto a canvas without thought; while UX without
          UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great
          product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential
          for the product’s success.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you’ve got room for one more analogy, Dain Miller sums up the
        relationship between UX and UI design perfectly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <br />
        <p>
          “UI is the saddle, the stirrups, and the reins. UX is the feeling you
          get being able to ride the horse.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <p>—Dain Miller, Web Developer</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It’s important to understand that UX and UI do go hand-in-hand; you
        can’t have one without the other. However, you don’t need to possess UI
        design skills to be a UX designer, and vice versa—UX and UI constitute
        separate roles with separate processes and tasks!
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>The main difference to bear in mind is this:</strong><br />
        UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI
        design is all about how the product’s interfaces look and function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A UX designer considers the user’s entire journey to solve a particular
        problem; what steps do they take? What tasks do they need to complete?
        How straightforward is the experience?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Much of their work focuses on finding out what kinds of problems and
        pain points users come up against and how a certain product might solve
        them. They’ll conduct extensive user research in order to find out who
        the target users are and what their needs are in relation to a certain
        product.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They’ll then map out the user’s journey across a product, considering
        things like information architecture—i.e., how the content is organized
        and labeled across a product—and what kinds of features the user might
        need. Eventually, they’ll create wireframes that set out the bare-bones
        blueprints for the product.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With the skeleton of the product mapped out, the UI designer steps in to
        bring it to life. The UI designer considers all the visual aspects of
        the user’s journey, including all the individual screens and touchpoints
        that the user might encounter, think tapping a button, scrolling down a
        page or swiping through an image gallery.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While the UX designer maps out the journey, the UI designer focuses on
        all the details that make this journey possible. That’s not to say that
        UI design is all about looks; UI designers have a huge impact on whether
        or not a product is accessible and inclusive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They’ll ask questions like “How can different color combinations be used
        to create contrast and enhance readability?”or “What color pairings
        cater to color blindness?” You can learn more about UI design for
        accessibility in our guide.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hopefully you’re now starting to see how UX and UI design are indeed two
        very different things. To summarize:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI
          design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing,
          interactive interfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          UX design usually comes first in the product development process,
          followed by UI. The UX designer maps out the bare bones of the user
          journey; the UI designer then fills it in with visual and interactive
          elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          UX can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; UI is
          specific to digital products and experiences.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2 id="how-do-ux-design-and-ui-design-work-together">
        3. How do UX design and UI design work together?
      </h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong
          >We’ve explored the differences between UX and UI; now, let’s take a
          look at how they work together. </strong
        >You might be wondering if one is more important than the other, but the
        reality is they’re both crucial! Allow me to quote designer and expert
        Helga Moreno, who put it rather eloquently in her article The Gap
        Between UX And UI Design:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <br />
        <p>
          “Something that looks great but is difficult to use is exemplary of
          great UI and poor UX. While something very usable that looks terrible
          is exemplary of great UX and poor UI.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      <p>
        As you can see, UX and UI go firmly hand in hand, and while there are
        millions of examples of great products with one and not the other,
        imagine how much more successful they might have been when strong in
        both fields.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        UI design is like the icing on the UX cake. Imagine you come up with an
        amazing idea for an app, something that’s clearly missing from the
        market and could genuinely change people’s lives for the better. You
        hire a UX designer to conduct user research and help you figure out
        exactly what features your app should have and how the entire user
        journey should be mapped out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Your app offers something that your target audience needs and wants;
        however, when they download it, they find that the text on each screen
        is barely legible (think the yellow text on a white background). What’s
        more, the buttons are too close together; they keep hitting the wrong
        button by mistake! This is a classic case of bad UI destroying what
        would have been good UX.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On the flip side, have you ever come across a really beautiful website
        only to find that, beyond the mind-blowing animations and on-point color
        scheme, it’s actually a real pain to use? Good UI can never make up for
        bad UX; it’s like picking up a beautifully decorated cake that actually
        tastes awful when you bite into it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So, when it comes to product design, UX and UI complement each other—and
        in today’s competitive market, getting both aspects right is an absolute
        must. Whether you choose to work as a UX designer or a UI designer, it’s
        useful to have an understanding of both; after all, you’ll inevitably be
        working together. This brings us to our next section…
