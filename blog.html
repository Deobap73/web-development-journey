          First day! The anticipation of the start of a new adventure, the first
          steps in a career completely different from anything I had done here,
          creates an tingling like I haven't felt in many years. <br /><br />
          Having the exact notion that this is the opportunity of a lifetime,
          the anxiety to get started is enormous.
          <br /><br />
          At the age of 49 and a half, which is characterized by essentially
          never having been a happy and accomplished person on a professional
          level, the beginning of this adventure that is Web Development gives
          me the hope of finally doing something that I truly enjoy
          professionally.
          <br /><br />
          Who would have thought that on August 24, 2020, when I ended my
          driving shift, I was struggling atrociously with unimaginable and
          impossible to describe pain, to the point of having entered the
          emergency room at the hospital in Rotthalmünster with a pain level of
          10 out of 10 and being immediately hospitalized for 5 days just for
          pain control, it would be the only (very painful) part of a long stage
          of surgeries, pain, suffering, tears and a lot of frustration that
          would bring me here to this new adventure….
          <br /><br />
          …. Web Development.

          February 10, 2023 <br /><br />
          8:45! -I turned on the computer, opened the Slack app to see if I had
          any relevant messages. I clicked on the link that takes me to the Zoom
          meeting.<br /><br />
          After some anticipation, the day finally arrived. This long journey of
          over a year has begun.<br /><br />
          New faces, new lives, new dynamics are about to enter my screen and
          who, throughout this learning that will take place online every day
          and week, will share this adventure with me.<br /><br />
          The first few hours are acquaintance, normal formalities.<br /><br />
          After introducing us to the Trainer who will accompany us on this
          adventure and after the first few minutes, something immediately jumps
          out, his calm manner (too calm) and somewhat disorganized with regard
          to the organization of thoughts shows that a lot of caffeine will be
          needed.<br /><br />
          With the day ending, there was some skepticism towards the
          trainer...<br /><br />
          ...as the week went on, my fears about the trainer's way of teaching
          were confirmed. He is definitely a know-it-all, but his peculiar way
          of teaching very slow and a little disorganized is creating serious
          concentration problems for me.<br /><br />
          It took us two days on a topic that should have been covered in one
          morning, frustration starts to get the better of me and we're still on
          the third day of training. I notice that the disgust with this
          situation is reflected in some other training colleagues. I confess
          that I am a very patient person with people, but inexplicably it is
          not like that, I feel frustrated because I expected much more
          (dynamics) and I fear that if it continues at this pace it will
          certainly not be an easy year…<br /><br />
          ...Friday, Soft Skills day. But what a breath of fresh air this day
          was. Dynamic, cheerful, with a lot of interaction between everyone and
          very, very interesting and enriching in terms of personal and
          collective knowledge.<br /><br />
          The Coach knew how to captivate us for this session from the first
          moment. Compared to the previous days, it was like a huge and
          much-needed decompression. I deeply regret that we are only presented
          with the presence of this Coach for two sessions.
