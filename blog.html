          February 7, 2023 <br /><br />
          First day! The anticipation of the start of a new adventure, the first
          steps in a career completely different from anything I had done here,
          creates an tingling like I haven't felt in many years. <br /><br />
          Having the exact notion that this is the opportunity of a lifetime,
          the anxiety to get started is enormous.
          <br /><br />
          At the age of 49 and a half, which is characterized by essentially
          never having been a happy and accomplished person on a professional
          level, the beginning of this adventure that is Web Development gives
          me the hope of finally doing something that I truly enjoy
          professionally.
          <br /><br />
          Who would have thought that on August 24, 2020, when I ended my
          driving shift, I was struggling atrociously with unimaginable and
          impossible to describe pain, to the point of having entered the
          emergency room at the hospital in Rotthalmünster with a pain level of
          10 out of 10 and being immediately hospitalized for 5 days just for
          pain control, it would be the only (very painful) part of a long stage
          of surgeries, pain, suffering, tears and a lot of frustration that
          would bring me here to this new adventure….
          <br /><br />
          …. Web Development.
        </div>

        <div class="blog-overview">
          February 10, 2023 <br /><br />
          8:45! -I turned on the computer, opened the Slack app to see if I had
          any relevant messages. I clicked on the link that takes me to the Zoom
          meeting.<br /><br />
          After some anticipation, the day finally arrived. This long journey of
          over a year has begun.<br /><br />
          New faces, new lives, new dynamics are about to enter my screen and
          who, throughout this learning that will take place online every day
          and week, will share this adventure with me.<br /><br />
          The first few hours are acquaintance, normal formalities.<br /><br />
          After introducing us to the Trainer who will accompany us on this
          adventure and after the first few minutes, something immediately jumps
          out, his calm manner (too calm) and somewhat disorganized with regard
          to the organization of thoughts shows that a lot of caffeine will be
          needed.<br /><br />
          With the day ending, there was some skepticism towards the
          trainer...<br /><br />
          ...as the week went on, my fears about the trainer's way of teaching
          were confirmed. He is definitely a know-it-all, but his peculiar way
          of teaching very slow and a little disorganized is creating serious
          concentration problems for me.<br /><br />
          It took us two days on a topic that should have been covered in one
          morning, frustration starts to get the better of me and we're still on
          the third day of training. I notice that the disgust with this
          situation is reflected in some other training colleagues. I confess
          that I am a very patient person with people, but inexplicably it is
          not like that, I feel frustrated because I expected much more
          (dynamics) and I fear that if it continues at this pace it will
          certainly not be an easy year…<br /><br />
          ...Friday, Soft Skills day. But what a breath of fresh air this day
          was. Dynamic, cheerful, with a lot of interaction between everyone and
          very, very interesting and enriching in terms of personal and
          collective knowledge.<br /><br />
          The Coach knew how to captivate us for this session from the first
          moment. Compared to the previous days, it was like a huge and
          much-needed decompression. I deeply regret that we are only presented
          with the presence of this Coach for two sessions.

        <h2 class="blog-title">week of contradictions</h2>
        <img src="./Images/Blog_3.png" class="blog-image" alt="" />

        <div class="blog-overview">
          <strong>February 13, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day. We are working on creating a code of
          conduct that will guide us throughout this training year. <br /><br />
          The way in which the topic was addressed throughout the morning was
          undoubtedly very interesting and constructive.<br /><br />
          During the afternoon we had the pleasure of having a different Basic
          Digital Literacy trainer who demonstrated, at least for me, what I
          have been thinking about teaching our resident trainer……<br /><br />
          <br /><br />
          <strong>February 14, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          …. the day got off to a bad start, really bad to tell you the truth,
          our resident coach came back and with him the disorganized
          teaching.<br /><br />
          It is not possible to try to teach commands in the “terminal” and not
          know what to respond to unforeseen situations.<br /><br />
          At one point, I lost my temper and was very direct in expressing my
          frustration with the matter.<br /><br />
          I should have had a different attitude, it wasn&#39;t good on my part
          and after the break I asked to speak in front of everyone, apologizing
          to the coach and other colleagues. <br /><br />
          I realized that my learning ambitions do not match the slow and
          disorganized way we are experiencing in this course, but obviously I
          will have to adapt to these conditions, so I will remain discreet for
          the sake of my path in this course and the well-being of other
          colleagues ...
          <br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 15, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          ,,, The day started strange and some people in the group started to
          feel the same frustration that I felt from the beginning.
          <br /><br />
          During the morning break, some people in the group decided to question
          the trainer about his way of teaching. I chose to turn off the camera
          and sound, I promised myself I&#39;ll keep a low profile, and I will.
          <br /><br />
          After resuming the class, things evolved in a more fluid way, I hope I
          can finally start talking here about everything that has to do with
          the Web Development course and nothing about everything else.
          <br /><br />
          We are essentially talking about the terminal installation of
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> There were some problems
          with the way it was demonstrated in class, personally I opted for a
          different and more effective approach, using different commands than
          those used in class…

          <ul>
            <li>source ~/.bashrc</li>
            <li>nvm list-remote</li>
            <li>
              nvm install v18.14.0
              <strong>
                in V18.14.0 you replace with the latest version or the one you
                want from the list presented in the previous command</strong
              >
            </li>
            <li>nvm lts/hydrogen installation</li>
            <li>node -v</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />with the last command should appear .....<br /><br />
          <br /><br />18.14.0<br /><br />
          <br /><br />After....<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>npm install -g npm@9.4.2</li>
            <li>sudo apt install rpm</li>
          </ul>
          Thereby keeping &quot;node.js&quot; and &quot;npm&quot; installed and
          updated<br /><br />
          In the afternoon the theme was centered on the “rpm” command<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>npm init</li>
            <li>code .</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />It is<br /><br />
          Install an “npm” package. Check if and where this package has been
          installed. What command was used to check if and where the package was
          installed?<br /><br />
          A way to test commands in the terminal.<br /><br />
          At the end we did an evaluation<br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 16, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          It was an interesting day dedicated to “Git”<br /><br />
          <strong>What is Git?</strong><br /><br />
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
          designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
          speed and efficiency.<br /><br />
          After that, we start its installation and start using basic commands
          for your use…
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>sudo apt-get install git</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          After installing it, start your terminal and type the following
          command to verify that Git is ready to be used on your computer:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git –version</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          In your terminal, run the following commands to identify yourself with
          Git:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot;</li>
            <li>git config --global user.email &quot;your@email.com&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          To create a new repository and start tracking your project with Git,
          use your terminal
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git init</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          This is a command that is very often used when working with Git. It
          shows us which files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git status</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br /><strong>staging files</strong><br /><br />
          From the project folder, we can use the git add command to add our
          files to the staging area, which allows them to be tracked. We can add
          a specific file to the staging area with the following command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git add file.js</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />o add multiple files, we can do this:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git add file.js file2.js file3.js</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Instead of having to add the files individually, we can also add all
          the files inside the project folder to the staging area:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git add .</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          By default, this adds all the files and folders inside the project
          folder to the staging area, from where they are ready to be committed
          and tracked.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Making commits</strong><br /><br />
          A commit is a snapshot of our code at a particular time, which we are
          saving to the commit history of our repository. After adding all the
          files that we want to track to the staging area with the
          <strong>git add</strong> command, we are ready to make a commit.
          <br /><br />
          To commit the files from the staging area, we use the following
          command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Inside the quotes, we should write a commit message which is used to
          identify it in the commit history.
          <br /><br />
          The commit message should be a descriptive summary of the changes you
          are committing to the repository.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Branching</strong><br /><br />
          Whenever we initialize a folder as a repository, there will be one
          default branch (typically called master).
          <br /><br />
          We can create a branch that is a copy of (usually) the main branch.
          Then you can add your changes to this branch without affecting the
          main branch.
          <br /><br /><strong>Creating a new branch</strong><br /><br />
          You can create a new branch using the following command:<br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>merging branches</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          Once we create a branch from master, they start living separate lives
          so to say. We don&#39;t want this to continue for too long, because it
          will become harder and harder to bring the two together.
          <br /><br />
          For example, after you fully implemented and tested a new feature in
          your code, you would want to merge those changes to the stable branch
          of your project (which is usually the default master branch). To merge
          the changes from a different branch into your current branch, you can
          use this command:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>git merge "branch-name"</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />t was a good day of learning...<br /><br />
          <br /><br /><strong>February 17, 2023</strong><br /><br />
          <em>soft skills day</em>
          <br /><br />
          Once again it was an interesting day where we focused on communication
          and feelings.<br /><br />
          We focus on “Communications Square - Friedemann Schulz von Thun” in
          <em>“Appreciative communication”</em><br /><br />
          In another topic we talk about the topic: non-violent communication
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>what we are feeling</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          The big difference goal: learn to differentiate own feelings from
          interpretation, diagnoses, thoughts
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Universal Needs</li>
          </ul>

          <br /><br />
          <p>
            A new week will start with a different Teacher, but who has already
            been with us before and with a teaching style that pleases.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&#39;ve covered <strong>&quot;git&quot;</strong> and
            <strong>&quot;GitHub&quot;</strong>...
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>The history of GIT</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Was created by Linus Torvalds to track changes to a project from
            multiple authors
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Who likes the idea of travelling through time?</h2>
          <br />

          <p>GIT is a way to travel through time for your project!</p>
          <br />
          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <br />
          <p>GIT is a command line tool</p>
          <p>We use GIT to keep track of changes to files</p>
          <p>
            We can travel through those changes and see how a project appeared
            earlier in time
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            GIT <strong>does not automatically</strong> add your changes,
            <strong>until you tell it to</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            GIT will keep track of any file changes after you&#39;ve used
            <strong>git add</strong> to track them
          </p>
          <p>
            Each change or set of changes are recorded within the GIT repository
            as a <strong>commit</strong>
          </p>
          <p>You can write a message with each commit</p>
          <br />
          <h2>Commit Messages</h2>
          <br />
          <p>Optional BUT</p>
          <br /><br />

          <h2>Who are you writing these messages for?</h2>
          <br />

          <p>NOT for the computer!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are writing for your future self</li>
            <li>
              Co-workers, future developers, anyone else who might be working on
              the project
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h2>What should you write?</h2>
          <br />

          <ul>
            <li>Your message should make sense</li>
            <li>
              The message should explain in a short summary - what that commit
              did - what was the purpose
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          <h2>Example of a bad commit message</h2>

            account
          </p>
          <p>There is no such thing as a &quot;GIT account&quot;</p>
          <p>When you configure GIT;</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot; git config

          </p>
          <p>
            There is no &quot;verification&quot; of that data - you can write
            anything you like
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want change any of the configuration settings, you can just

          <h2>Local and remote repositories</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Local = anything that is available locally on your machine Remote =
            a repository which lives on a shared network resource
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>GitHub</strong> really shines here - the most post popular
            and easy to use remote GIT service
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>git remote -v</strong> - view the link to the remote
            repository
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can link to your remote repositories using either the
            <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocol or the <strong>SSH</strong> protocol
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>HTTPS</h3>
          <br />

          <p>
            Using <strong>HTTPS</strong> means that every time you want to
            interact with your remote repository, you have to enter your
            username and password
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>SSH</h3>
          <br />

          <p>Secure Shell</p>
          <p>
            Before you can use <strong>SSH</strong>, you have to generate an
            <strong>SSH</strong> key - which will automatically be used when you
            interact with your remote repository
          </p>
          <p>
            More work to setup to setup at the start, but saves you time
            compared to HTTPS
          </p>

          <h2>Working in a Team</h2>
          <br />

          <p>Example..... 2 people want to work together</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Dieter</li>
            <li>Mary</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li><p>One of these people must create a repository</p></li>
            <li><p>Mary creates the repository on GitHub</p></li>
            <li><p>She shares the URL of the repository with Dieter</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>She uses <strong>git clone</strong> to make a copy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Dieter uses <strong>git clone</strong> to make a copy</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />

          <h2>GIT commits</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            When you create a commit, the contents of that commit should be
            related to each other
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you make changes to the homepage - when you make
            your commit for the homepage, it should only include those changes
            for the homepage
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Preparing a commit</h3>
          <br />

          <ol>
            <li>
              Before you can create a commit, you must add the files to the
              commit with <strong>git add</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>git add .</strong> - adds everything
            <strong>git add index.html</strong> - add just index.html
          </p>
          <ol start="2">
            <li>
              <strong>git commit -m &quot;Here is my message&quot;</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />

          <h2>Commands</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            <strong>git push</strong> - sends new commits to the
            <strong>remote repository</strong>. Only sends commits!
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Any changes outside of a commit are NOT sent (pushed) to the
              remote
            </p>
            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>git pull</strong> - pulls changes from the
            <strong>remote repository</strong> to the
            <strong>local repository</strong>
          </p>
          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you have any uncommitted changes,
              <strong>git pull</strong> will abort
            </p>
            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>git fetch</strong> - ask the remote, have any new branches
            been added?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>git checkout {branch}</strong> - checks out to a specific
            branch, for example <strong>git checkout main</strong> will take you
            to the <strong>main</strong> branch
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Branches</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Within your repository, you can have multiple versions of the code
            you are working on
          </p>
          <p>
            Most repositories will have a <strong>main</strong> or
            <strong>master</strong> branch, which represents the up-to-date
            version of the application.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Why use branches?</h2>
          <br />

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              If you&#39;re working on your own, you don&#39;t need to use
              branches!
            </p>
            <br />
          </blockquote>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When you&#39;re working in a team, if everybody commits to the
              same branch - it gets messy very quickly, because you are dealing
              with multiple commits and some of these commits may override each
              other (merge conflict)
            </li>
            <li>
              What if you make a mistake? What if you break the code? Working in
              a separate branch means your code is isolated from the rest of the
              team - any faults would be contained.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />

          <h2>Working with branches</h2>
          <br />

          <p><strong>git branch</strong> - lists all local branches</p>
          <p>
            <strong>git checkout {branchname}</strong> - moves to the branch
            specified in the command
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>git checkout -b {branchname}</strong> - creates a new branch
            with the name specified in the command

          <br />
          <blockquote>
            <p>

          <p>
            When you&#39;re working on a project, you should not be working in

              branch <strong>homepage</strong> into your current branch

            ,,, Today we start a new Module
            <em><strong>&quot;User Interface Basic&quot;</strong></em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard language used to
            create the structure and content of web pages. HTML provides a basic
            user interface for displaying text, images, and other media on the
            internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of user interface, HTML provides the building blocks for
            creating interactive elements like buttons, forms, and menus. These
            elements can be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create
            a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML also provides the ability to include hyperlinks, which allow
            users to navigate between pages and websites. This is an essential
            aspect of the user interface as it enables users to access the
            information they are looking for quickly and efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, HTML provides the foundation for creating a user-friendly
            and interactive web interface. By using HTML along with CSS and
            other programming languages, developers can create complex web
            applications and websites that are easy to use and navigate.

          <br /><br />

          <p>
            Day dedicated to Soft Skills with the theme
            <em><strong>&quot;Intercultural Competences&quot;</strong></em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>But what are <em>Intercultural Competences?</em></p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Intercultural competences refer to the ability to understand,
            communicate, and interact effectively with people from different
            cultures. It involves the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to
            navigate diverse cultural settings and to build positive
            relationships with people from different backgrounds.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Some common intercultural competences include:</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Cultural awareness: having an understanding of one&#39;s own
            cultural background and being open to learning about other cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication skills: being able to communicate effectively with
            people from different cultures, including the ability to listen
            actively, ask questions, and provide feedback.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Flexibility and adaptability: being able to adjust one&#39;s
            behavior and communication style to fit different cultural contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy: being able to understand and appreciate the perspectives
            and experiences of people from different cultures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Conflict resolution skills: being able to resolve conflicts that may
            arise in intercultural interactions, including the ability to
            negotiate, compromise, and find mutually acceptable solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing intercultural competences is becoming increasingly
            important in our globalized world, where people from different
            cultures are increasingly working and living together.
