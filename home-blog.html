            <p class="blog-overview_1">First day!

                The anticipation of the start of a new adventure, the first steps in a career completely different from anything I had done here, creates an tingling like I haven't felt in many years.
                <br><br>
                Having the exact notion that this is the opportunity of a lifetime, the anxiety to get started is enormous.
                <br><br>
                At the age of 49 and a half, which is characterized by essentially never having been a happy and accomplished person on a professional level, the beginning of this adventure that is Web Development gives me the hope of finally doing something that I truly enjoy professionally.
                <br><br>
                Who would have thought that on August 24, 2020, when I ended my driving shift, I was struggling atrociously with unimaginable and impossible to describe pain, to the point of having entered the emergency room at the hospital in Rotthalmünster with a pain level of 10 out of 10 and being immediately hospitalized for 5 days just for pain control, it would be the only (very painful) part of a long stage of surgeries, pain, suffering, tears and a lot of frustration that would bring me here to this new adventure….
                <br><br>
                …. Web Development.</p>
